/*
    In this program we are going to find LCM
    we first find GCD using Euclidean Algorithm and then we can calculate LCM using below formula
    a*b = gcd(a,b)*lcm(a,b)
    hence, lcm(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b)
    Itâ€™s based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.
